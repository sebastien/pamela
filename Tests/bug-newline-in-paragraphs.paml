		<h4:The price of health
		<p
			“He that has not health, has nothing,” claims an old French
			proverb, and like other developed countries, America spends a good
			fifth of its budget on health and medicare. But unlike these
			countries, it does not offer universal care: for every dollar the
			government spends on health, another dollar comes out of private
			insurance plans or patients’ pockets.
		<p
			Taking this into account, Americans spend more on health and
			medicare than any other nation. Yet this does not seem to buy them
			better health: in fact, they have a shorter-than-average life
			expectancy and a higher-than-average child mortality rate. The
			reason, speculates the Congressional Research Service, is that
			prices for medical services are abnormally high.
